# Monster Hunter: Optimal Set Explorer and Finder
A small project to help Monster Hunter World players find the optimal armour set meeting specific conditions using the power of integer linear programming.

You can check the demo at https://delca.github.io/MHOSEF/

## Current features
- Maximizes the number of slots while minimizing the number of items to equip
- Uses skills from the armour pieces, the charm and the armour set bonuses
- Ensures that the set will reach the given level for the required skills

## Missing features
- Only uses data from Monster Hunter World
- ~~Does not take into account shared set bonuses between Alpha and Beta sets~~
- Does not take into account special skills such as Xeno'jiiva Divinity,
- Does not use decorations to improve the set
- Does not take the weapon into account
- Does not take into account other stats such as defense, affinity, etc
- Does not allow to choose which parameters to optimize the set around
- Does not show the items and skills' description and statistics
- Everything else I do not know about the game's mechanics (I have not play the game yet ðŸ˜Š)
